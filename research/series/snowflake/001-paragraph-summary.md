# Paragraph Summary

## Story Setup

In bits and pieces, in remote and unexpected places, groups of blue angels are
appearing and establishing colonies. All the major governments begin checking
them out and establishing contact and relations with them. They appear to be
peaceful. But are they?

This will be the story of Sarah Bitar immediately after changing. The trick
will be setting up the rest of the story in subtle ways.

## Major Disasters

### I

The angels meet with a collection of world leaders at the UN, and they encase
New York City and other major cities in a crystalline substance that sings
unsettlingly and dementedly. The angels then declare that the earth is ruled by
Sha-Rin, the leader of the angels. Or perhaps it's their god. It's kind of hard
to tell.

#### A

This is the story of the Bitars investigating the colony of angels in the
desert outside Damascus.

approach.

#### C

The angels agree to meet the world governments at the UN. But it's a trap. New
York City and other major world cities are crystallized.

### II

In response, armies attack, but it's chaotic. The angels are able to easily
parry the various armies against each other or defeat them outright using what
appears to be magic. But at the end of the battle, there's little
infrastructure left in major cities. In the meantime, the angels start to
insist upon tribute from the world governments---or more likely from
lower-level institutions and structures that are still working. At first,
everyone assumes that they want resources of some kind, but at the end it
becomes clear that they want people. (Children? How dark is this going to be?)

### III

Shapeshifters, who've been lurking since long before the beginning, help
assemble a guerilla rebellion. It gains some small victories before being
crushed. In the process, most of the shapeshifters who remain are killed. The
one left has severe amnesia, which helped to keep her from being killed. In the
course of this set, it also becomes clear that the realm of Sha-Rin is
beginning to overlap the earth, that in a sense, the earth is losing its
identity and being drawn into the alternative existence of Sha-Rin.

### IV

When New York was crystallized, from the inside it was actually pulled into
Sha-Rin. A small-time businessman was able to maintain his sanity on the other
side and begin to construct a world on the other side. On this side his niece's
infant is pulled into the other side (and people realize that the permeability
goes both ways, for what it's worth). The niece is able to pull her daughter
back, but at the expense of being replaced in her life with a witch/changeling
and being trapped inside a prison. Eventually, she must work together with her
husband to restore her life after the witch takes off, and the businessman
gives himself (apparently), although in reality he's switched himself with an
infant being born on this side.

### V

This is going to be a little vague, especially since this is so late in the
series. I may flesh this out some as I outline the book level preceding it.

* Do I need another one between IV and V?
* The businessman begins to grow up and is more than a little insane.
* The girl grows up and has strange powers (and general strangeness herself).
* More and more, people begin to penetrate Sha-Rin, wrecking havoc on that side
  as well.
* This brings together the businessman, the girl, Elaine Li, and the Bitars.

## Ending

Eventually, the angels must close the gates and withdraw in order to protect
Sha-Rin from the damage that's being caused by terrorists going over there. Our
world is still in a shambles, however. What will it take to fix it?

# Explanation

Take another hour and expand that sentence to a full paragraph describing the
story setup, major disasters, and ending of the novel. This is the analog of
the second stage of the snowflake. I like to structure a story as "three
disasters plus an ending". Each of the disasters takes a quarter of the book
to develop and the ending takes the final quarter. I don't know if this is the
ideal structure, it's just my personal taste.

If you believe in the Three-Act structure, then the first disaster corresponds
to the end of Act 1. The second disaster is the mid-point of Act 2. The third
disaster is the end of Act 2, and forces Act 3 which wraps things up. It is OK
to have the first disaster be caused by external circumstances, but I think
that the second and third disasters should be caused by the protagonist's
attempts to "fix things." Things just get worse and worse.

You can also use this paragraph in your proposal. Ideally, your paragraph will
have about five sentences. One sentence to give me the backdrop and story
setup. Then one sentence each for your three disasters. Then one more sentence
to tell the ending. If this sounds suspiciously like back-cover copy, it's
because . . . that's what it is and that's where it's going to appear someday.
