Teresa is the queen of a city on the edge of a wasteland. There is a faction of
the court who doesn't like her, though, and wants to replace her with a
noblewoman. One of their complaints is that she hasn't produced an heir yet.
When she finally has a baby daughter, though, she thinks that things are
looking up. Then the child starts to act strangely, to cry all the time, and to
change physically too, subtly. Teresa begins to suspect that her daughter has
been replaced by a changeling.

Teresa is afraid to take action on the changeling immediately, but she
begins to probe and test to see where her daughter is and who is holding her.
She goes to consult the seer, who is no help whatsoever. While she's trying to
navigate some court intrigues, she holds off on doing anything. Finally, she,
her best friend, and her mother attempt to draw her daughter, but they fail.
And whoever is holding the child only tightens her grip on them.

> I need some specific people for the court intrigue.

After her failure drawing the child, she finally goes to see the witch-woman.
She refuses to help Teresa, but she lets slip the location of the mythical
Gateway, and maybe something about the Mage (clues for later).  Meanwhile,
Teresa's continued meetings, secretive and hurried, raise Edward's suspicions.
He enlists Oglevy to monitor her. Teresa takes him into her confidence, and he
twists this and mis-represents it to Edward to make him more suspicious. Teresa
takes a trip to visit her birth mother at this point, and learns that everyone
had thought that her sister was a changeling before she disappeared down the
river. Edward becomes aware of Oglevy's troop movements, but he thinks that
Teresa and the priestesses are behind it, partially because of Teresa's sudden
absence. He has her arrested, and he starts bringing in the other main
priestesses too.

After some inexplicable interrogations, and just before her execution, Teresa
is able to escape. She crosses the river into the Desolate Kingdom, and with
great adventure and sacrifice, she makes it across to the Gateway.  Teresa is
alone at this point, and she crosses over. The Mage meets her and takes her to
her sister, who is addled, and who has Madeline. But Teresa cannot take the child
from her, and she cannot have it cross back anyway. [Why?  That seems odd.] She
also learns who her sister's changeling became, and what her purpose was. In
the end, the Mage has to pull her away, both for her own sanity, and because
Edward has caught up with her and is preparing to attack the Gateway.

Back in her world, Teresa stops Edward from attacking the Gateway. They return
home, to find Oglevy already in the palace. They are able to escape, and Teresa
helps Edward take the castle back. Once that's settled, she visits the
witch-woman again, and offers her her own place. The witch-woman was supposed
to be *her* changeling, and Teresa offers to let her become that---in exchange
for getting her child back. The witch-woman agrees and draws then child. She
then leaves, after binding Teresa and the child to the cave.

By this stage, you should have a good idea of the large-scale structure of
your novel, and you have only spent a day or two. Well, truthfully, you may
have spent as much as a week, but it doesn't matter. If the story is broken,
you know it now, rather than after investing 500 hours in a rambling first
draft. So now just keep growing the story. Take several hours and expand each
sentence of your summary paragraph into a full paragraph. All but the last
paragraph should end in a disaster. The final paragraph should tell how the
book ends.

This is a lot of fun, and at the end of the exercise, you have a pretty decent
one-page skeleton of your novel. It's okay if you can't get it all onto one
single-spaced page. What matters is that you are growing the ideas that will
go into your story. You are expanding the conflict. You should now have a
synopsis suitable for a proposal, although there is a better alternative for
proposals . . .
