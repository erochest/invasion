** Deeper Characterization
*** Meaningful Past

/One traumatic event from the character's past that shaped his or her
future. To connect this event to my own life, it may--while being a
different event--have the same emotional impact./

*** Need

/The wound should leave the character with a need so intense that he or
she will be driven to fulfill it. These needs are universal, such as
belonging, love, family, self-worth, or faith./

*** Weakness

/The wound should leave the character with a weakness, a character flaw
that seems out of the control or beyond the full awareness of the
character./

*** Strength

/The wound may also gift the character with a heroic strength that
increases his or her determination to fill the need and reach the plot
goal./
